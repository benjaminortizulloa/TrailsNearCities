                The CDC recently reported that "the number of states in which at least 35% of residents have obesity has nearly doubled since 2018." 
                Today, there are 16 states that reach this 35% threshold. 
                <sup><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0915-obesity-rate.html" target="_blank">1</a></a></sup>

                Minorities suffer even more than the general population with nearly half the Black population and 45% of the Latinx population having obesity. 
                <sup><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/09/29/1041515129/obesity-rates-rise-during-pandemic-fueled-by-stress-job-loss-sedentary-lifestyle" target="_blank">2</a></sup>
                More minority families shouldered the economic brunt of the pandemic because they represent a greater share of the low-wage or essential workforce.
                This suggests we search for an equitable solution to obesity that takes financial constraints into account.

                Luckily, congress passed the National Trails System Act in 1968 
                <sup><a href="https://www.americantrails.org/national-recreation-trails/about" target="_blank">3</a></sup>
                which honors trails that are open to the public, represents their region, and supports a diverse community.
