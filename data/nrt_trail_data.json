For most of its length, the River has a steady current to enhance the enjoyment of navigation.  The Trail provides an abundance of natural environment experiences that contrasts with rural and small town to semi-urban landscapes all in view from the paddlers√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ perspective. The Trail begins in the Village of Holly and ends in the Village of Chesaning with sufficient well-spaced public access points.  Paddlers enjoy a mostly beginner√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rating waterway.  There are three required portages with mill ponds upstream from dams with one of the dams also supporting a lake level that permits the only large-motorized section of the trail at Lake Ponemah.  History and culture are richly endowed and communicated qualities of the Trail that also provide for related paddler experiences.  There are State-recognized conservation sites and environmental educational programs.
